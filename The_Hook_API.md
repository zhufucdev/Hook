# The Hook API
API is a way to communicate with Hook, which can be accessed in the main.js script
## Guideline
The API should be a consistent, event-based and full-function coding experience.

**Note:** The Hook API hasn't been fully constructed yet. Changes expected.
## functions
### addEventListener(eventName, callback)
*parameters*
- **callback: function** triggered when the given event happens
- **eventName: string** can be one of the followings

|Name|Description|Callback Parameter|
|:---|:----------|:-----------------|
|documentLoaded|When a document is ready to be shown|[JSDocumentView](Hook/Plugin/Interpret/JSDocumentView.cs)|
|documentClosed|When a document is about to be closed|[JSDocumentView](Hook/Plugin/Interpret/JSDocumentView.cs)|
|unload|When the plugin is about to be unloaded, usually app shutingdown or user uninstalling the plugin|nothing|
|systemStartup|When the plugin is loaded because of system starting up|nothing|

### getOpenedDocuments()
*return:* a read-only array containing each document shown in the tab view.

*see:* [DocumentView](Hook/Plugin/Interpret/JSDocumentView.cs)

#### param: callback(path: string|integer|null)

If the file was successfully downloaded, *path* will be its absolute path to the local filesystem.

Otherwise, a null parameter is given in a system exception.

### httpAsString(uri: string, callback: function)

If the file was successfully downloaded, *content* will be the desired string content.
If it's an http error, it's state code will be given.

### openDucment(path: string)

### writeline(content: any)

### showInfoBar(title: string, message: string, severity: string = "")
Write some text into the InfoBar section.
#### param: severity
Different severity corresponds to different background colors and icons.

`error`,`warning`,`success`,`default`

*see:* [Guide by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/infobar#severity)

## Properties
### window: [JSWindow](Hook/Plugin/Interpret/JSWindow.cs)
Represents the window of the app.
#### activate: function
Activate the application.
#### tryEnterFullscreen: function
Try to eneter fullscreen mode for the app.
### plugin: [JSPluginWrapper](Hook/Plugin/Interpret/JSPluginWrapper.cs)
#### createShortcut: function(name, description, [iconSymbol, ]path)
##### param name: string

Title of the shortcut, displayed as the document name.

##### param description: string
Subtitle of the shortcut, displayed like the document last touched date.

##### param iconSymbol: string
Icon to be displayed.

*See:* [Symbol by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.symbol?view=winrt-22000)

##### param path: function(progressUpdater, resultInvoker)|string
This parameter can either be a string constant, a function that returns a string const or a function that
returns nothing and invokes its second argument with a string const. All you need to do is to provide the path
to the file to be opened by this method.

The **progressUpdater** parameter is a function that receives a double as the indicator of current progress, 
which ranges from 0 to 100 as percentage.

#### settings: [JSSettings](Hook/Plugin/JSSettings.cs)
##### get: function(key)
Get the value of a specific settings item.

*param key: string* The only identity of the settings item.

*return* Value of the desired item.
##### put: function(key, value)
Modify the value of a specific settings item.

*param key: string* Identity of the item to be modified.

*param value: string* Value to modify.

**Note:** value you put should be consistent with what is written
in the plugin manifest.

Your settings should be user-interactive, which is implenented by
adding external controls in the Settings page. To make that work,
screen info and data type should be defined.
So here is the pattern of settings manifest in plugin.json you should follow.
```json
{
	//basic plugin info...
	"settings": {
		"<Item Key 1>": {
			"title": "<Title of the item, displayed like a preference name>",
			"description": "<Description of the item, working as a detailed explanation of this item>",
			"icon": "<Symbol by Microsoft>",
			"type": "int|long|double|string|bool",
			["range": "\[|(<number>,<number>\]|)"] // available only if it's a numeric type
		},
		//maybe more settings items...
	}
}
```
Your Plugin Settings should look like this:
